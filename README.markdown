# intro

PrivCount is an independent implementation of the PrivEx Secret Sharing (S2) variant, that has
been customized in order to be able to aggregate a large variety of statistical counts from Tor
while providing differential privacy guarantees. For more information, see the associated
publication:

# requirements

Base components:

    system libs: libssl libssl-dev cffi
    python libs: pyyaml, twisted, pyopenssl, service-identity, cryptography

Optional graphing extensions (required only for the `plot` subcommand):

    system libs: libpng libpng-devel, #TODO this list is incomplete
    python libs: numpy, matplotlib

System libs can be install with `apt-get`, `yum`, `brew`, etc. Python libs can be installed with `pip`,
as we explain below.

# installation

I recommend using virtual environments to isolate the python environment and avoid conflicts.
Run the following from the base directory of this package (i.e., the same location of this README).
(If you're using OS X or ubuntu, you might need to use "sudo -H" before some of the pip commands.)

    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt # excludes the optional numpy and matplotlib libraries
    pip install -I .
    test/run_test.sh . # run the unit tests to check your setup
    deactivate

# running

To run PrivCount, simply activate the virtual environment that you created earlier and then run
PrivCount as normal. For example:

    source venv/bin/activate # enter the virtual environment
    privcount --help
    ...
    deactivate # exit the virtual environment

# testing

See `test/README.markdown` for notes about testing PrivCount in a private local deployment, or just run the unit tests:

    source venv/bin/activate # enter the virtual environment
    test/run_test.sh -I .
    deactivate # exit the virtual environment

# deploying PrivCount entities

Example of the global section for a `privcount-config.yml` file, which all nodes need:

    global:
        start_time: 1452520800 # 2016-01-11 at 2pm UTC
        epoch: 604800 # (1 week = 604800 seconds) the safe time frame of stats collection for all stats
        clock_skew: 300 # seconds - to deal with clock skews and latency

## tally server

Generate key and create self signed cert in a new base directory:

    mkdir privcount_ts
    cd privcount_ts
    touch privcount-config.yml # add above global config in here
    openssl genrsa -out ts.key 4096
    openssl req -new -x509 -key ts.key -out ts.cert -days 1825

Choose an address W1.X1.Y1.Z1 and port P1 that is accessible on the Internet, and append the
following as a new section under the global section of the `privcount-config.yml` file:

    tally_server:
        listen_port: P1 # open port on which to listen for remote connections from TKSes
        key: 'ts.key' # path to the key file
        cert: 'ts.cert' # path to the certificate file
        results: 'results.txt'

Then run PrivCount in tally server mode:

    privcount privcount-config.yml ts

## tally key server

Generate key and create self signed cert in a new base directory:

    mkdir privcount_tks
    cd privcount_tks
    touch privcount-config.yml # add above global config in here
    openssl genrsa -out tks.key 4096
    openssl req -new -x509 -key tks.key -out tks.cert -days 1825

Choose an address W2.X2.Y2.Z2 port P2 that is accessible on the Internet, and append the
following as a new section under the global section of the `privcount-config.yml` file:

    tally_key_server:
        listen_port: P2 # open port on which to listen for remote connections from DCs
        key: 'tks.key' # path to the key file
        cert: 'tks.cert' # path to the certificate file
        tally_server_info: # where the tally server is located
            ip: W1.X1.Y1.Z1
            port: P1

Then run PrivCount in tally key server mode:

    privcount privcount-config.yml tks

## data collector

Create a new base directory:

    mkdir privcount_dc
    cd privcount_dc
    touch privcount-config.yml # add above global config in here

Choose a local port L that will listen for connections from Tor.

data_collector:
    listen_port: L # local port on which to listen for local connections from Tor
    noise_weight: 1.0 # distribute noise among all machines / data collectors
    tally_server_info: # where the tally server is located
        ip: W1.X1.Y1.Z1
        port: P1
    tally_key_server_infos: # where the tally key servers are located
        -
            ip: W2.X2.Y2.Z2
            port: P2
    statistics: ... # see test/privcount-test-config.yaml
