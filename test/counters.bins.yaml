# histograms represent a collection of counters (bins) that together define a
# histogram

# Follow these steps to update this file:
# 1. Add new counters to privcount/counter.py
# 2. Run privcount/tools/add_counter.sh
# 3. Manually add bins to the multi-bin counters
# All Time, Ratio, and Histogram counters are multi-bin.
# Some legacy Count counters are multi-bin, check the source or run the
# injector test and look for the assertion failures.

# when you modify the counters in this file, run:
# test/test_counter_match.sh
